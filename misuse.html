        <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities. </p>
        <P>Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. </P>
        <P>The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. </P>
        <P>Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances. Elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water.</P>
        <P>Water pollution is a major global problem. It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases.</P>
        
       <p>How many of us who drink water from sealed bottles (pet bottle) carry with them if the water is still remaining ? And how many of us throw that water in the nearby plant as we feel this water will become non-drinkable for the next day? Water is not perishable after 24 hours, but it will certainly perish from the world if not well-preserved. Knowingly, not unknowingly, we waste water every day. We do not understand the wastage while doing small-small things as part of our daily routine.
