        <p>Sources Of water </p>
        <P>Water is constantly moving on the Earth between the atmosphere, ocean, rivers and streams, snowpacks and ice sheets, and underground. Water availability, both as surface water and groundwater, is essential for agriculture, human consumption, industry, and energy generation.</P>
        <P>About 71 percent of the Earth's surface is water-covered, and the oceans hold about 96.5 percent of all Earth's water. Water also exists in the air as water vapor, in rivers and lakes, in icecaps and glaciers, in the ground as soil moisture and in aquifers</P>
        <P>Water Availability </P>
        <P>Water availability is the quantity of water that can be used for human purposes without significant harm to ecosystems or other users. ... Surface waters receive water from both runoff and discharges from ground water. Ground water, in turn, relies on water recharge from the land surface</P>
        
        <p>Water Availability in India </p>
        <p>The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1816 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively which may further reduce to 1486 cubic meters and 1367 cubic meters in the years 2021 and 2031 respectively.</p>
